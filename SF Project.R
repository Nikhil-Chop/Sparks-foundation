#Based on our EDA findings, we can draw the following conclusions and recommendations:
  
#The dataset consists of 9994 observations and 13 variables, and there are no missing values in the dataset.
#The distribution of sales is positively skewed, with a long tail to the right. This indicates that a few orders have very high sales, while most orders have low to moderate sales.
The relationship between profit and sales varies by region. Some regions, such as Central and South, have a stronger positive relationship between profit and sales than others. The company could focus on increasing sales in regions with weaker relationships between profit and sales.
The product categories with the highest sales are Office Supplies, Furniture, and Technology. The company could focus on increasing sales in these categories to improve overall profitability.
There is a moderate positive correlation between sales and profit, which suggests that increasing sales could lead to higher profits. However, there is also a negative correlation between discount and profit, meaning that offering too many discounts could decrease profits. The company could focus on reducing discounts to increase profitability.
There are a few outliers in the dataset, particularly in the sales and profit variables. These outliers could represent unusual or unexpected events, such as large orders or unusually high discounts. The company could investigate these outliers to identify any potential issues or opportunities for improvement.
Finally, the company could consider using predictive modeling techniques, such as regression analysis or decision trees, to identify the factors that most strongly influence sales and profits. This could help the company to make more informed decisions about pricing, discounting, and marketing strategies.
Based on these conclusions and recommendations, the company could take the following actions to improve profitability:
  
  Focus on increasing sales in regions with weaker relationships between profit and sales, while also targeting the Office Supplies, Furniture, and Technology categories.
Reduce the number of discounts offered, while maintaining competitive pricing.
Investigate the outliers in the dataset to identify any potential issues or opportunities for improvement.
Use predictive modeling techniques to identify the factors that most strongly influence sales and profits, and use this information to make more informed decisions about pricing, discounting, and marketing strategies.

#Now second question is "As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can
# Group the data by Region and calculate the mean profit
library(dplyr)

profit_by_region <-data %>% 
  group_by(Region) %>% 
  summarise(mean_profit = mean(Profit))
#Order the data by mean profit in descending order
profit_by_region <- profit_by_region %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_profit))
# Print the resulting table
profit_by_region
#This will give you a table showing the total profit for each region, sorted from highest to lowest.

#After running the command "profit_by_region <- profit_by_region %>% arrange(desc(mean_profit))", you can run the following command to answer the question "As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit" in R:
profit_by_region[profit_by_region$mean_profit < 0, ]
#This will give you a subset of the profit_by_region dataframe where the mean_profit is less than 0, indicating regions where the company is making a loss on average. You can then investigate these regions further to identify any specific factors that may be contributing to the low profits, and take steps to address them.
#To plot the mean profit by region, you can use the ggplot2 package in R:
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(profit_by_region, aes(x = Region, y = mean_profit)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Mean Profit by Region",
       x = "Region",
       y = "Mean Profit")
This code creates a bar chart where each region is represented by a bar with the height corresponding to the mean profit for that region. The labs() function is used to add a title and axis labels to the plot.
#The output of the last command suggests that the regions "Central" and "South" have weaker relationships between sales and profit compared to other regions. Therefore, a business manager may focus on improving sales in these regions to increase profitability.

# Here's how you can explore the business problems that can be derived from the SampleSuperstore dataset
1.Low profit margins: We can see that there is a moderate positive correlation between sales and profit, but the profit margins are not very high. To address this issue, the company could focus on reducing costs, such as shipping costs and overhead expenses.
library(dplyr)

# calculate profit margin
data %>%
  mutate(profit_margin = (Profit / Sales) * 100) %>%
  summarize(mean_profit_margin = mean(profit_margin))
2.Discount strategies: We can see that there is a negative correlation between discount and profit. This indicates that the company may be offering too many discounts or not targeting them effectively. To improve profit margins, the company could analyze its discount strategies and optimize them for maximum profitability.
# analyze discount and profit
data %>%
  select(Discount, Profit) %>%
  group_by(Discount) %>%
  summarize(mean_profit = mean(Profit)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Discount, y = mean_profit)) +
  geom_line()
3.Sales by product category: We can see that the product categories with the highest sales are Office Supplies, Furniture, and Technology. To increase profits, the company could focus on increasing sales in these categories by introducing new products or improving marketing strategies.
# analyze sales by product category
data%>%
  group_by(Category) %>%
  summarize(total_sales = sum(Sales)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Category, y = total_sales)) +
  geom_col()
4.Sales by region: We can see that the relationship between profit and sales varies by region, with some regions having a stronger positive relationship than others. To increase profits, the company could focus on improving sales in regions with weaker relationships between profit and sales.
# analyze sales and profit by region
profit_by_region <- data %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarize(mean_sales = mean(Sales),
            mean_profit = mean(Profit)) %>%
  mutate(profit_margin = (mean_profit / mean_sales) * 100)

# plot profit margin by region
profit_by_region %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_profit)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Region, y = profit_margin)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip()
